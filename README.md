# Pick-A-Potato
For P1 I have attempted to make my version of a 
whack a mole style game, using just html, css and vanilla JavaScript. 

In my game, the player will press the start button, which will initiate the countdown timer, as well as the pop up function which will cause potatoes to appear on screen to be clicked on.

At the end of the game, the players score will be displayed. At which point the game can be restarted.
